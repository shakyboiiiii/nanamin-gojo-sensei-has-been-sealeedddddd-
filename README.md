Eminem, born Marshall Bruce Mathers III on October 17, 1972, is straight-up one of the most iconic and influential rappers of all time. Hailing from Detroit, Michigan, he popped off in the late '90s with his wild alter ego Slim Shady, dropping The Slim Shady LP in 1999 and instantly grabbing the world's attention with his raw, no-holds-barred lyrics and twisted humor. Known for his insane lyrical ability, rapid-fire flow, and super personal storytelling, he’s dropped hit after hit like “Lose Yourself,” “Stan,” “Rap God,” “Mockingbird,” and “Love the Way You Lie.” His semi-autobiographical movie 8 Mile showed his come-up in Detroit’s underground rap scene and even scored him an Oscar for “Lose Yourself,” which is wild considering he didn’t even show up to the awards that night. He’s sparked hella controversy over the years, feuding with celebs and other rappers, and constantly pushing boundaries with his brutally honest bars—but that’s part of what made him legendary. Despite coming into a Black-dominated genre as a white dude, he’s always paid respect to the culture and earned his stripes, becoming one of the best-selling artists ever. Oh, and let’s not forget, he also helped launch other big names like 50 Cent. Basically, he’s the rap game’s GOAT and still drops tracks that go crazy, even after decades in the game.
