<p>Pizza</p> <p><img src="download.jpg" style="width:170px; height: 170px; margin-left:15px; float: right; "> Pizza (Italian: ['pittsa], Neapolitan: ['pittsa]) is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo. </p> <hr>
